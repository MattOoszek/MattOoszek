- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattOoszek. 
- I am glad that I can get to know and learn something new, even though programming is not a complete stranger to me :). I like making music and designing graphics.
- 👀 I’m interested in how programs and applications are made. I would like to deepen my knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and getting to know the GitHub function.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with someone who will help me take my first steps ;)
